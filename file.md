PHP Vulnerability Scanner
This repository contains a PHP vulnerability scanner, a tool designed to identify security vulnerabilities in PHP applications. The scanner utilizes various techniques and checks to detect common security weaknesses and potential exploits in PHP code.

Features
Static Analysis: The scanner performs static analysis on PHP source code to identify potential vulnerabilities. It analyzes the code structure, variable usage, function calls, and other patterns to detect security flaws.
Vulnerability Detection: The scanner incorporates a set of predefined rules and checks to identify common vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), remote code execution, file inclusion, and more.
Extensibility: The tool allows for easy extensibility by providing an API that allows developers to create custom vulnerability checks and add them to the scanning process.
Reporting: After scanning a PHP application, the scanner generates a detailed report highlighting the identified vulnerabilities, including their severity, affected code snippets, and recommendations for remediation.
Requirements
PHP 7.0 or higher
Composer (for installing dependencies)
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/php-vulnerability-scanner.git
Change to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd php-vulnerability-scanner
Install the dependencies using Composer:

bash
Copy code
composer install
Usage
Navigate to the project directory.

Run the vulnerability scanner command, providing the path to the PHP application you want to scan:

bash
Copy code
php scanner.php /path/to/php/application
Replace /path/to/php/application with the actual path to your PHP application.

Wait for the scanner to analyze the code and generate the report.

Once the scanning process is complete, the tool will generate a report file containing information about the identified vulnerabilities.

Extending the Scanner
The scanner can be extended by creating custom vulnerability checks. To add a custom check, follow these steps:

Create a new PHP class that extends the VulnerabilityCheck class.

Implement the check() method, which performs the necessary analysis to identify the vulnerability.

Register the new check with the scanner by adding an instance of your custom class to the $checks array in the scanner.php file.

Re-run the scanner to include the custom check in the scanning process.
